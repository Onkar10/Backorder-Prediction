Material backorder is a common SUPPLY CHAIN PROBLEM,
impacting an inventory system service level and effectiveness.
Identifying parts with the highest chances of shortage prior
its occurrence can present a high opportunity to improve an
overall companyâ€™s performance.

In this project, a MACHINE LEARNING
CLASSIFIER is investigated in order to propose a predictive model
for this imbalanced class problem, where the relative frequency of
items that go on backorder is rare when compared to items
that do not. Specific metrics such as area under the Receiver
Operator Characteristic and precision-recall curves, sampling
techniques and ensemble learning are employed in this particular
task. Results are presented and future scope is discussed.
